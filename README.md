This Solidity contract represents a simple real estate listing system. It allows users to list properties for sale by providing details such as name, location, price, and description. Each property is stored in a mapping with a unique ID, and the contract keeps track of all listed property IDs in an array. The properties are stored with their owner's address and are marked as for sale.
